                My name is Evan, and I'm known under the alias "nrv-ous". 
                Most of the Lua experience on my toolbelt has been from the 
                Roblox game engine; although I have ventured outside into  
                areas such as Love2D and Luv.it. I'm also familiar with 
                many languages, though most of my experiences outside of
                Lua come from C++ and Python. I've yet to have any significant
                progress though, at least project-wise (which I do intend to change).
